PI Python Libraries
===================

PIPython is a collection of Python modules to access a PI device and process
GCS data. It can be used with Python 2.7+ and 3.4+ on Windows, Linux and OS X
and without the GCS DLL also on any other platform.

Version: 1.5.0.10


Quickstart
----------

Communicate to a PI device via *GCSDevice* which wraps the GCS commands
and provides methods to connect to the device. Call *GCSDevice* with the
controller name as argument::

    from pipython import GCSDevice
    gcs = GCSDevice('C-884')
    gcs.InterfaceSetupDlg()
    print gcs.qIDN()
    gcs.CloseConnection()
